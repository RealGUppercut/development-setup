# Install Node.js with Node Version Manager (aka NVM)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a powerful and popular open-source runtime
environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web
browser.

It's vast ecosystem of modules and libraries, make it versatile for a wide
range of applications, including server-side web development, network
applications, real-time chat applications, and more.

We'll use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and
manage Node.js for us. Let's get started:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Install NVM

  Let's download and install nvm

  ```sh copy
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
  ```
  This will have installed nvm, but to get started using it in the terminal
  we're currently using we can source out zsh config with the following command

  ```sh copy
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```
  We now have nvm setup, and can install a Node.js version of our choosing.
  
  ### Step 2: Install Node.js 18.x

  At the time of writing, the LTS version is 18. We're going to use nvm now to
  get that installed:

  ```sh copy
  nvm install 18
  ```

  You should see the following output in your terminal:

  ```
  Downloading and installing node v18.16.0...
  Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.0/node-v18.16.0-linux-x64.tar.xz...
  ################################################################################################################# 100.0%
  Computing checksum with sha256sum
  Checksums matched!
  Now using node v18.16.0 (npm v9.5.1)
  Creating default alias: default -> 18 (-> v18.16.0)
  ```

  Now, if you type `node --version` you will `v18.16.0` confirming it's setup
  and you're ready to start building web applications ðŸŽ‰.
