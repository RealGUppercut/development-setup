# Windows 10 & 11

Windows has introduced a new feature for all PCs â€“ the Windows Subsystem
for Linux, also known as WSL. This remarkable feature enables you to
incorporate a Linux distribution (commonly referred to as "distro"),
such as Ubuntu Linux, and seamlessly integrate it with the Windows File
System.

In this guide we will get WSL2 configured and install Ubuntu. You can then
follow the [Ubuntu](/web-development/ubuntu) guide to complete your setup.
