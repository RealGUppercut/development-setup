# Install Ubuntu using WSL2

Now that we have enabled Virtualization, we can install Ubuntu using the WSL
feature.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Launch Powershell
  We'll use Windows Powershell to setup WSL. Open the Windows Menu, type
  `powershell` and open the application.

### Step 2: Install WSL & Ubuntu

Within Powershell, we will now install the Ubuntu Operating System with WSL.
You will be prompted for Administrator permissions during this process,
please press Yes to these prompts.

```sh copy
wsl --install
```

  Once this has completed, be sure to **restart your computer**!

### Step 3: Install Ubuntu (continued)

Now, we'll repeat the last two steps to finalise the installation. Open the
Menu, once again type `powershell`, open the Application and in the window
that appears type:

```sh copy
wsl --install
```

You will be prompted for a
**<span style={{ color: "#BB6BD9" }}>Username & Password</span>** during the
setup. These will be your credentials for the Ubuntu installation, and is
seperate to your Windows username and password. We recommend keeping this
simple.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Password prompts will often be left blank as you type and will not
  display `xxx`, or `***` in it's place.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Launch Ubuntu

Open the Windows Menu, and type "Ubuntu". You should see a new Application as
pictured below. Launch the Application, and proceed to follow our Ubuntu
Setup Guide.
