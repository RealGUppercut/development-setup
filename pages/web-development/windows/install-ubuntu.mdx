# Install Ubuntu using WSL2

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Launch Powershell
  We'll use Windows Powershell to setup WSL. Open the Windows Menu, type
  `powershell` and open the application.

  ### Step 2: Install WSL & Ubuntu
  Within Powershell, we will now install the Ubuntu Operating System with WSL.
  You will be prompted for Administrator permissions during this process, 
  please press Yes to these prompts.

  ```
  wsl --install
  ```

    Once this has completed, be sure to **restart your computer**!

  ### Step 3: Install Ubuntu (continued)
  Now, we'll repeat the last two steps to finalise the installation. Open the 
  Windows Menu, once again type `powershell`, open the Application and in the
  window that appears type:

  ```
  wsl --install
  ```
  You will be prompted for a
  **<span style={{ color: "#BB6BD9" }}>Username & Password</span>** during the
  setup. These will be your credentials for the Ubuntu installation, and is
  seperate to your Windows username and password. We recommend keeping this
  simple.

  Setup Guide.
