# Setup Hardware Virtualization
 
A fairly complicated initial step is to ensure your hardware is configured and
that [Hardware Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization)
is enabled so that you can run another operating system on your Windows PC.

This will allow you to run Ubuntu on your Windows Desktop Environment.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Check it's current status
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    If Virtualization is enabled, you can skip the rest of this document and
    [Install Ubuntu](./install-ubuntu)
  </Callout>

  We can check whether Virtualization has been enabled by opening the 
  "Task Manager", you can open this tool by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`.

  Selecting the **<span style={{"color": "#BB6BD9"}}>"Performance"</span>** Tab
  at the top, you should be presented with some beautiful charts detailing your
  computer's current load.

  Clicking **<span style={{"color": "#27AE60"}}>CPU on the left</span>**, and
  you will see the following; look for the information about

  ### Step 2: Restart into Recovery Mode
  We will need to configure your PC hardware to enable Windows to Virtualize.
  We will do this in BIOS/UEFI.

  Let's launch Windows into Recovery Mode. Open the Windows Menu, type
  "Recovery Options" and open the application:

  Once the settings window appears click the 
  **<span style={{"color": "#27AE60"}}>Restart Now</span>** button.

  ### Step 3: Restart into UEFI
  Your PC/Laptop will restart and show the following menu. Using your arrow
  keys to navigate and the enter key to make a selection follow these steps:

  1. Select **Troubleshoot**
  2. Select **Advanced Options**
  3. Select **UEFI Firmware Settings**

  ### Step 4: Enable CPU Virtualization
  Once your computer has restarted you will enter into BIOS/UEFI.

  This is the most complicated step of the entire guide. Unfortunately, this
  option is   different with every manufacturer. It will be found under an
  option for CPU Configuration; on Intel CPUs this feature is often referred to
  as `Intel Virtualization Technology`, `Intel VT`; whereas for AMD CPUs this
  feature is referred to as `AMD-V`, or `SVM Mode`.

  We recommend Googling the process for your hardware
  [Enable CPU Virtualization in bios on a &lt;YOUR DEVICE&gt;](https://www.google.com/search?q=enable+cpu+virtualization+in+bios+on+a+),
  for example "enable CPU Virtualization in bios on a Lenovo Laptop" or please
