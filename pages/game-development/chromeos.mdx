# Enabling linux

To get your Chromebook ready for development work we will need to enable Linux.  
Linux is off by default but you can turn it on with the simple steps below.  

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Check if you have Linux

  If your Chromebook was made in 2019 or more recently then skip to step two.
  If your Chromebook was manufactured before 2019 then [click here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux) to see a list of Chromebooks with Linux

    If your Chromebook isn't listed here and was made before 2019 then it is likely that you do not have Linux and will be unable to continue.

  ### Step 2: Turn on Linux

  1. On your Chromebook, at the bottom right, select the time.
  2. Select Settings -> Advanced -> Developers.
  3. Next to ‘Linux development environment’, select Turn on.
  4. Follow the on-screen instructions. Setup can take 10 minutes or more.
  5. A terminal window opens. You will have a Debian 11 (Bullseye) environment. You can run Linux commands, install more tools using the APT package manager and customise your shell.
